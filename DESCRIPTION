Description: Implements non-parametric tests from Higgins (2004, ISBN:0534387756), including tests for one sample, two samples, k samples, paired comparisons, blocked designs, trends and association. Built with 'Rcpp' for efficiency and 'R6' for flexible, object-oriented design, the package provides a unified framework for performing or creating custom permutation tests.
